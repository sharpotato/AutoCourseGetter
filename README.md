# AutoCourseGetter

Hello Project Viewers! This WIP project is intended to be able to have a UC Merced student search for a class, get several details, such as course id, units given, badge requirements, and more. If the student wants the class, they can add it's, and other wanted classes, id numbers to our bot. When it is the student's registration time, also provided by the student, the bot will automatically try to make a schedule with the id numbers. If there is a conflict or a class is unavailable, the student will recieve an email at a provided address.
This project uses a database hosted on MongoDB Atlas, with data stored, accessed, and modified using Python.

Website is still being worked on, .py files are for back-end, index.html is the current setup of the website.
